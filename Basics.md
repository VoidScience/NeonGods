You have 4 basic **Approaches** to solving problems and overcoming obstacles in the world:
- **Prowess**: Physical skill and ability
- **Wits**: Quick thinking and reasoning
- **Savvy**: Social skills and charm
- **Violence**: Physical violence and threats of harm

You have two primary **Resources** to draw upon:
- **Resolve**: Your ability to go on in the face of adversity and endure hardship
- **Will**: Your ability to manipulate Quintessence and alter the world around you

There are three basic rolls in Neon Gods:
- **The Risk Roll**: For engaging in a risky activity where one of the other rolls doesn’t apply
- **The Discernment Roll**: For learning things about the world around you 
- **The Combat Roll**: When you engage in violent confrontation while armed, intending to do damage, and do so with an opponent that is capable of defending themselves

For all rolls, gather d6s equal to your rating in your **Approach**. If you have a Background that can apply OR equipment beyond the minimum needed to do the job add a d6 to your Dice Pool, or as many as the equipment states. 

Roll the dice, if the highest die rolled is a 6, this is a **Success**. If it is a 4 or 5 this is a **Success With a Cost**, you get less than you wanted or with a consequence of complication. If your highest die roll was a 3 or less than prepare for the worst. 

If you roll a 3 or less, you can spend 1 Resolve to convert a **Failure** into a **Success With a Cost**.

**Esoteric Procedures**: When you perform an Esoteric Procedure, make your roll as normal; however you must roll at least 1 Will Die, up to a maximum of your current Will. If you **Fail** an Esoteric Procedure, you can spend 1 Will to convert the roll into a **Success With a Cost**. If you roll any 1s (Banes) on your Will Dice, decrease your current Will by 1 and roll a d10 on the appropriate Backlash Table for the number of Banes rolled. 

**Dealing and Taking Damage**: If you Succeed on a Combat Roll, deal the damage of your weapon to your target. If you get a Success With a Cost, you both deal damage to your target and they deal damage to you in the form of Stress. On a Failure you take damage in the form of Stress. Reduce any damage dealt or taken by the DR value of any armor worn. When Stress exceeds your current Resolve, take a Wound and roll on the Wound Table, reset the Stress track to zero. 

**Critical Successes**:
